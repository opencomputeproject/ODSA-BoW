# Introduction 

The Bunch of Wires (BoW) specification is a very simple, open and interoperable 
physical interface between any 2 or more  chiplets or chip-scale-packages (CSP) 
on a common package.

This specification will describe the BoW interface.  The specification also leaves 
open the possibility of pin-compatible interfaces that operate at higher data rates 
for increased throughput per chip edge.  This specification also describes a 
terminated mode that operates at increased data rates.  It is also possible 
that in the future other BoW-compatible technology enhancements will further 
increase throughput per chipedge.  Examples of this include previous discussions 
on a Turbo mode using simultaneous bidirectional communication.  That mode is not 
covered in this draft.

## Objectives

The BoW interface is a set of backward compatible die-to-die parallel 
interfaces that provides the flexibility to trade off throughput/wire, 
design complexity, cost, packaging technology. Backward as defined by 
every new mode being compatible with the "Basic mode" defined in this 
specification. Each future version of this specification is expected 
to be compatible with at least two previous significant versions.
The use of the BoW is expected to be confined to connect die
placed closed to one another within the same package. Signal loss
in transmission is expected to be lower than for off-package protocols. 
The BoW interface aims to meet the following design objectives:

* Inexpensive to implement 
* Portable across process nodes ranging from 28nm to 5nm
* Portable across multiple bump pitches
* Have the flexibility to support advancing packaging technology
* Unencumbered by technology license costs
* Very low power (< 1 pJ/bit) as defined by Tx IO Pad, wire and Rx IO Pad.
* Very low latency: <5 ns without FEC, <15 ns with FEC. Latency as 
defined from the PCS parallel interface at the source, through Tx 
interface, channel, Rx interface received at the PCS parallel 
interface at the receiver. Based on experience, the 5 ns 
target meets the latency requirements of high-performance 
applications and has been demonstrated to be achievable.
* Unidirectional throughput/Chip Edge target range:
  - Minimum Targets
    - 100 Gbps/mm with all packaging options
    - 1 Tbps/mm with advanced packaging options
    - Enable higher throughput at very short reach < 1 mm.
  - As reference examples, with a data rate of 4 Gbps/wire
    - achieve 200+ Gbps/mm with a bump pitch of 130um and with a die 
    edge stack depth no greater than 2 routing layers with organic 
    laminate packaging.
    - achieve 1+ Tbps/mm with a bump pitch of 50 um and with a die edge 
    stack depth no greater than 4 routing layers with advanced 
    packaging.

## Advantages

The Bunch of Wires interface provides several key advantages for chiplet based systems:

* Can operate at higher data rates per pin than existing parallel standards
  *  -or-  lower data rates for compatibility with existing parallel standards
* Can be implemented in legacy technologies (process nodes) with generally available IP
* Terminated mode can be implemented in less effort than a traditional SERDES
* Does not require silicon based interconnect
* Is not constrained or intended to be used with a specific bump pitch
  * Two BoW interfaces can each be implemented at different bump pitches and can be 
  directly connected on an organic substrate, through fanout technology or through 
  silicon based interconnect.

While the advantages and simplicity are excellent benefits, the BoW interface does 
require more package routing traces than other serial based XSR or USR interconnect.
This drives BoW implementations that need the highest bandwidth to use fine bump 
pitches and ‘stacked’ BoW implementations, adding some complexity and cost in test 
and packaging.  Lower bandwidth implementations are free to use more standard 
packaging technology with coarse bump pitch.

Failure to meet the requirement results in non-compliance
* "Should" indicates a strong suggestion, but not a requirement.
Failure to implement the suggestion does not result in non-compliance.
* "May" indicates an option.
* The lack of one of the above verbs indicates the material is informative.

## Compliance Summary

The must specifications must be met over process variation, supply voltage range and 
temperature range (PVT). 
Each implementation must document its supported supply voltage range and temperature range.

Table XX will summarize the compliance points that shall be met in order to meet the BoW requirements. Each of the 
compliance points is discussed in the specification.

This section will also include a discussion on interoperability.

# BoW Overview
Chiplet-based designs require physical and logical connectivity between the die in a
single package. They also require the use of more complex packaging to accommodate the
multiple die sharing a package. This section provides an overview of the BoW physical 
interface, its use in a multi-chipletdesign, and how with the Open Domain-Specific 
Architecture stack it can be used as an underlay for popular transaction protocols.

## BoW Application
The BoW is intended to be an energy-efficient easy-to-use PHY
interface between a pair of die as shown in Figure [#fig-bow_overview].
The BoW

  * Provides physical digital connectivity between the die
  * Can be used with multiple packaging technologies including organic laminate, interposers,
  bridges and RDL
  * Requires a separate protocol for the logical transport of information between the die

A unidirectional slice is the basic unit of BoW physical connectivity. Any BoW interface between a
pair of die is composed of one or more slices. 
Figure [#fig-slice_signals] shows the component signals of a BoW slice between
two die and is specified in detail below in Section [#sec-signal-definitions]

## BoW Inside the Chiplet

Within a chiplet, a BoW slice  transports bits from a link layer controller through 
the edge of the die to wires on the packaging substrate, as shown in 
Figure [#fig-bow-components]. A BoW slice implementation may be decomposed
into a datapath and a control path.

Per-slice, The datapath consists of the clock and data signals shown in 
Figure [#fig-slice_signals]. On one side, the on-die BoW datapath 
terminates in bumps, at the edge of the die connected to wires on the substrate. 
Internally, the datapath is connected to a Link Layer controller. The datapath is 
also expected to include serializer (deserializer) logic on transmit (receive) 
that is not specified in this document.

The BoW control path stores information to initialize and operate the datapath in status
registers.  The control path outputs information to manage the
datapath. The interface between the control and datapath is specific to an
implementation. The BoW PHY may be implemented with the control and datapath physically 
commingled. Implementing them separately allows the control logic to be
implemented in a separate block for multi-slice macros. The 
control path may also receive input from  an external digital control and management 
bus such as I2C to coordinate interface operation with other components in the package.

Any BoW implementation must receive a clock input from a PLL, which may be
shared across multiple slices. A BoW Rx slice is  expected to forward the clock received 
from the far side to the core logic. A BoW Tx slice is expected to forward its PLL clock
to the die's core logic. This will place all clock transitions in the core logic.

## BoW in the Package
Within the package, the BoW datapath is transported on physical passive wires between 
the pair of connected die. The specifics of the wires, such as their density,
maximum length, impedence characteristics and how they are realized vary with
the packaging technology. 


## BoW for Common Transaction Protocols
Multi-chiplet designs require both physical and logical connectivty between
connected die.
To enable chiplets from multiple vendors to interoperate and be integrated in a 
multi-die package, the ODSA aims to define an open physical and logical interface 
for chiplets, as shown in Figure [#fig-odsa-stack]. The Bunch of Wires is an open 
D2D PHY option in the interface. The logical component of the ODSA interface aims to 
support protocols used commonly for the two most common chiplet use cases, package 
aggregation and die disaggregation across a wide range of open and proprietary D2D PHYs
such as PCIe, CXL, CCIX, AXI and proprietary streaming protocols. 

~ Figure {#fig-odsa-stack; caption: "The BoW PHY in the ODSA Stack"}
![bowspec_figstack]
~

[bowspec_figstack]: images/bowspec_odsa_stack.jpg "bowspec_figure1" {width:auto; max-width:100%}

The ODSA stack abstracts
the PHY layer from the logical interface by using well-defined abstraction interfaces.
Specifically, the ODSA will use two abstraction interfaces, the PIPE and LPIF
interfaces. Any logic transaction controller, say a PCIe controller for example, that
supports a PIPE (LPIF) interface can use any D2D PHY that also supports a PIPE (LPIF)
interface as a physical layer to transport protocol bits between die.
As shown in Figure [#fig-odsa-stack], the BoW interface may need to receive data
through either the PIPE or LPIF interfaces to support common transaction protocols. 
For this use case, the BoW interface will have to be
augmented with an interface-specific adapter to support a protocol controller. The 
serializer/de-serializer functionality may also be integrated with the adapter. The 
specifications for each adapter are outside the scope of this document. 
Figure [#fig-bow-pcie] shows how the
BoW with an example PIPE adapter can be an underlay to transport PCIe transactions.

## BoW Modes
BoW is designed and specified so as to be en extensible protocol. The minimum
"BoW Basic" definition is defined to be a performance-competitive cross-package
easy-to-design and use PHY. Extensibility allows designers to further gracefully 
trade-off design and/or packaging complexity for performance in one or more
parameters of interest. 

Extensions may be open or proprietary. All modes are source synchronous 
parallel interfaces using a differential clock that may operate at multiple.
The range of operating frequencies for a mode must be documented in a data sheet. 
frequencies. Beyond the basic mode, adding termination provides higher performance 
per mm of beachfront bandwidth but is more complex to design. It ismay also be possible
to get higher performance by using 

All modes must be 
interoperable with the minimum definition. 
The various BoW modes are specified such that they can be directly connected 
to one another. ** When two interfaces are connected, data rate for the operating mode must be 
configured such that both ends support the same configuration at the same data rate.** All 
BoW implementations must support the minimum configuration of BoW (2Gbps datarate, 
1 Ghz clock rate, un-terminated IO). 

In each mode, a BoW interface can operate at multiple frequencies.
The operating frequency and throughput per wire on a BoW interface mode will be affected by:

* The choice of packaging technology
* The physical distance between the chiplets being connected: Faster data rates may be easier 
to realize with chiplets that are physically closer 
* Bump spacing: Coarse bumps may allow for circuitry to enable faster data rates.

The BoW specification provides for optional technology to increase the data rate per wire, 
to enable a graceful cost-performance tradeoff. 
It is also possible for basic BoW configuration implemented with advanced packaging or 
between physically close chiplets to offer a higher data rate per wire than a terminated 
BoW interface in some configurations. A high level view of the BoW Interface Data-rate ranges is shown below:

### BoW Basic Mode 

In BoW Basic, 
data rates can go up to 5 or 8 Gbps, depending on the package technology and wire length.
Wires are source-terminated (in the transmit circuit), but not terminated at the receiver.

### BoW Fast Mode

In BoW Fast, data rates can go up to 16 Gbps.
Wires are both source-terminated and receiver-terminated to 
minimize signal reflections to enable higher data rates and longer wires.

### Modes and Data Rates

Bow links shall follow the specifications in the following table. Add interop
columns.

All BoW links are DDR (double data rate). 
DDR is defined as one data bit transmitted for each rising and each falling edge of the clock.

"Laminate" is intended to include organic laminate packages (a.k.a. buildup) and similar 
technologies with approximately 25 um line and space rules.
"Interposer" is intended to include silicon interposer and similar technologies 
with approximately 1 um line and space rules.

All BoW implementations must support the minimum 1 GHz clock rate, 
2 Gbps data rate using source-terminated I/O.
For ease of interoperation, data rate multiples of 
N Gbps should be supported for integer N>=2 to the max rate for that implementation.

### BoW Mode Extensions

System designers are allowed the flexbility to extend the two BoW modes defined above provided, at a minimum, the 
BoW Basic Mode (Section 2.3.1) is supported to guarantee interoperability with other BoW PHY implementations.

# Signal Definitions

Each BoW slice consists of a differential clock pair, 16 single-ended data wires, 
and optional FEC and AUX wires. Each BoW slice is unidirectional when in operation.
A chiplet may be designed with with Rx-only and Tx-only slices, or
each slice may have both Tx and Rx capability which is configured at runtime. 
A bidirectional link is composed of some number of slices configured for Rx and some for Tx.

FEC (Forward Error Correction) is an optional signal that allows using FEC to 
improve the bit error rate (BER).  AUX is an optional signal that can be used for purposes
such as DBI, flow control, redundancy, etc. Chiplets A and B will need to agree on
the details on FEC and AUX usage.

A BoW link is only specified for operation inside a package for reach and ESD reasons.

## BoW Modes

There are multiple BoW modes. All modes must be 
interoperable with the minimum definition. All modes are source synchronous 
parallel interfaces using a differential clock that may operate at multiple frequencies.
The range of operating frequencies for a mode must be documented in a data sheet. 
frequencies. Beyond the basic mode, adding termination provides higher performance 
per mm of beachfront bandwidth but is more complex to design. It is also possible
to get high performance by using 

## Control Signals


An BoW interface shall provide control and status bits for calibration and communication of 
control and status information between the transmitter(receiver) and receiver(transmitter) chiplets. 
These status bits shall be implemented as documented in Section XX.xxx.xx.


Transmit Slice Shift Register

A Transmit slice shall include two shift registers: one for holding Transmit control and status 
signals to its link partner (the Transmit shift register), and one for receiving control 
and status signals from its interface partner (the Receive-copy shift register). 
The Transmit shift register shall contain 81 bits. The Receive-copy shift register 
shall contain 73 bits. All bits shall be implemented regardless of whether optional 
signals are implemented. Any signals not implemented shall permanently maintain their 
default values as defined in Table 50.


Receive Slice Shift Register

A Receive slice shall include two shift registers: one for holding Receive control and status
 signals to its interface partner (the Receive register), and one for receiving  control 
 and status signals from its link partner (the Transmit-copy shift register). 
 The Receive shift register shall contain 73 bits. The Transmit-copy shift register 
 shall contain 81 bits. All bits shall be implemented regardless of whether optional
  signals are implemented. Any signals not implemented shall permanently maintain their
   default values as defined in Table 51

Control Signals
 Control signals fall into one of the following categories:

* Calibration handshake
* Selective reset
* User-defined
* Reserved

The bits for any unused signals shall be maintained with default values for correct shift- register length.
The control signals are summarized in Table 11 and are detailed in Table 51.

Calibration Status Signals

Calibration status signals shall be generated by internal state machines as described in Section 3.2.3.

User-Defined Signals 

    User-defined signals are available for application use. 
    Since both sides need to understand the function of user-defined signals, 
    using these signals may limit chiplet interoperability. If implemented in an application, 
    user-defined signals should be described in the chiplet data sheet.

The following datarates and reach targets are recommended for BoW implementation using
advanced packaging:

All BoW links are DDR (double data rate). 
DDR is defined as one data bit transmitted for each rising and each falling edge of the clock.

"Laminate" is intended to include organic laminate packages (a.k.a. buildup) and similar 
technologies with approximately 25 um line and space rules.
"Advanced" is intended to include silicon interposer and similar technologies which are often
more resistive than organic laminate packages and must operate with reduced trace lengths.  Termination 
(source or double) may not be necessary for implementations targeting Advanced packaging.

Table 10 defines the control signals for Transmit and Receive slices. The table is organized by signal type; in-order signal tables with default values are provided in Section 7.2. tx_ prefixes refer to signals originating on the Transmit slice; rx_ prefixes refer to signals originating on the Receive slice.

# BoW Physicals

## BoW Components

A BoW link between two chiplets is made up of
wires, slices, and stacks. 

* The basic unit is a slice with 18 or 20 signal bumps. 
It must have 2 signals for the differential
clock and 16 single-ended data. 
It may also have the optional single-ended signals AUX and FEC. 
In the reference bump map, the long edge of a slice is parallel to the chip edge.
* Multiple slices may be placed in a stack. The slice positions are
designated A, B, C, etc, starting with the slice closest to the edge of the chip.
* A link from one chiplet to another must be composed of one or more
stacks placed along the chip edge. A link may be
configured with equal numbers of Rx and Tx slices,
or it may be asymmetric or one-way.

## Example Link

The minimal bidirectional reference link is shown in Figure [#fig-min_link].

In this example, each chiplet has one Tx slice and one Rx slice, 
arranged in a single stack on each chiplet.
The position-A slices (at the chips' edges) are connected together on the topmost routing 
layer used for signals and the position-B slices are connected together on the next 
layer used for signals.


Each BoW slice consists of a differential clock pair, 16 single-ended data wires, 
and optional wires FEC and AUX. Each BoW slice is unidirectional when in operation.
A chiplet may be designed with with Rx-only and Tx-only slices, or
each slice may have both Tx and Rx capability, one of which is selected at runtime. 
A bidirectional link is composed of some number of slices configured for Rx and some for Tx.

FEC (Forward Error Correction) is an optional signal that allows using FEC to 
improve the bit error rate (BER).  AUX is an optional signal that can be used for purposes
such as DBI, flow control, redundancy, etc. Chiplets A and B will need to agree on
the details on FEC and AUX usage, which is defined in the Link layer.

This reference example uses hexagonal closest packing for the bumps: two rows for signal bumps and
one row for power and ground bumps. 
In this pattern, the wire pitch is half the bump pitch.
In order to maintain the closest bump packing, slices in rows B and D must have a different bump
pattern than slices A and C.
But bump patterns are not specified by BoW; only the signal *ordering* at 
the chip edge is specified for interoperability. 

Alternate bump arrangements may include:
90-degree rotation of the hexagonal packing direction to decrease the wire pitch 14%;
square bump arrays instead of hexagonal for regularity of layout; 
more than two rows of signal bumps to decrease the wire pitch;
different ordering of power and ground bumps;
multiple power and ground rows.

An alternate slice arrangement may be to place the Tx and Rx slices side by side at the 
chip edges. This would take up more chip edge, but allow all the signals to run on the same 
package layer.

Somewhat different wire and bump pitches between two chiplets can be accomodated with 
fan-out in the chip-to-chip wires. This is limited in BoW Basic by the 10 mm max wire length 
and the practical advantages of routing from chiplet to chiplet in just one package layer.
(Note that even straight wires in slice position D are likely 5-6 mm long using 130-um bump pitch with 
the reference bump map in an organic package.)

## Cross Section

A cross section for an organic laminate (a.k.a. "buildup") package is shown in 
Figure [#fig-pkg_cross_section].

~ Figure { #fig-pkg_cross_section; caption: "Cross section of a BoW Link in an Organic Laminate Package" }
![pkg_cross_section]
[pkg_cross_section]: images/bowspec_figure_pkg_cross_section.PNG { width:auto; max-width:70% }
~

In an organic laminate package, signal layers should be alternated with ground layers 
in order to maintain a controlled impedance of 50 ohms. 
In interposer or other high-density packaging, the use of layers may be different.

In any technology, the position-A slice on chiplet A must be connected to the position-A 
slice on chiplet B (one must be configured for Tx and one for Rx). 
The position-B slices are connected together, and so on.


There is no specified limit to the number of slices in a stack. 
In organic laminate, the practical limit in 2020 is an 8-2-8 laminate which supports 4 slices. 
Layers on the bottom side of the package typically cannot be used for BoW signals 
due to low via density passing through the thick central core layer.


## Signal Ordering 

~ Framed {color: blue}
Ken sez: I copied this table from the HotI 2020 paper, but what is our 
supporting data for 8 Gbps cases?

A BoW interface must conform to these wire and slice order rules at the edge of the chip:


* The signals for a Tx slice are in the following order at the chip edge, 
going clockwise around the chiplet: 
AUX, D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, CLK+, CLK-, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12, D13, D14, D15, FEC
* The signals for an Rx slice are in the reversed order (ascending goes counter-clockwise)
* The Tx slices in a link are numbered from 0 at the upper left edge of the link 
(facing from the chip center to the edge) and ascending through the Tx slices in a stack, 
then from stack to stack clockwise.
* The Rx slices in a link are numbered from 0 at the upper right, through the Rx slices in a stack,
then stack to stack counterclockwise.

These rules allow BoW chiplets to be connected without signal reordering regardless of chiplet rotations.


In organic packages, each slice position should be associated with one signal layer and there is no mixing 
of signals from multiple slices.
In interposer or other dense routing technologies, signals from multiple slices in a stack 
may be interleaved in a signal layer, but chiplet A's slice A is still 
connected to chiplet B's slice A 
and similarly for position B, C, etc.


## Checkerboard Slice Pattern

For bidirectional links with more than one stack on each side, a checkerboard pattern of 
Tx and Rx slices should be used (Figure [#fig-checkerboard]).
This allows connection of chiplets with differing stack depths and 
numbers of stacks to be as efficient as possible. 
Figure [#fig-checkerboard] shows a bidirectional link with 4 stacks or 4 slices each, 
for 8 Tx and 8 Rx slices on each chiplet.

~ Figure { #fig-checkerboard; caption: "Checkerboard Pattern of Tx and Rx Slices in a 1.25 Tb/s Link" }
![checkerboard]
[checkerboard]: images/bowspec_figure_checkerboard.PNG { width:auto; max-width:70% }

~

An alternate approach may be used: provision every slice to operate as either Rx or Tx. 
This allows complete flexibility in interoperability and also provides an opportunity for
wafer-test loopback testing.


In BoW Base at 5 Gb/s, link in Figure [#fig-checkerboard] provides a total of 1.25 Tb/s.
In an organic substrate using the hexagonal bump pattern of Figure [#fig-min_link], 
if the bump pitch is 130 um, 
the total edge width is 4.16 mm without AUX and FEC, or 5.2 mm with; the depth from the edge is 1.35 mm.
In an interposer, if the bump pitch is 40 um, the edge width is 1.28 or 1.60 mm and the depth is 0.42 mm.

## Clocking

~ Figure { #fig-clocking; caption: "BoW Clock and Data Block Diagram - One Tx Slice, One Rx Slice" }
![clocking]
[clocking]: images/bowspec_figure_PHY_block.PNG { width:auto; max-width:100% }
~

Figure [#fig-clocking] shows the clock and data flow for a single Tx slice and a single Rx slice.
On the Tx side, data bits (and optional FEC and AUX bits) come in a wide word from the link layer, 
and are serialized to the line rate. 
At the Rx side, they are sampled with a common slicer clock in BoW Basic. 
BoW Fast may optionally implement per-bit delay adjust or per-bit slicer clock adjust.

All BoW interfaces shall be DDR (Double Data Rate) at the chip-to-chip interface: 
the data bit rate is twice the clock frequency, 
so data is clocked in on both edges of the clock in the Rx slice.

The following table provides clock and data rates for an example with 4 Gbps wire data rate 
and M=4 to support a 1 Gbps data rate at the Link-PHY interface.

~ TableFigure {#tab-; caption: "Example Clock and Data Rates for Figure [#fig-clocking] with 4 Gbps, M=4"; width:100%;  }

|---------------------------------|--------|-----------|
~

The ratio M should be limited to integers, preferrably powers of two, and other ratios 
implemented in a gearbox in the Link layer. 

The DDR clock TxClk is provided to the Tx PHY from elsewhere on Chiplet-A.
This may come from an on-chip PLL (typically shared across multiple slices) or it 
can be routed from the RxClk of an Rx slice on Chiplet-A. 
In order to meet duty cycle requirements, a Duty Cycle Corrector (DCC) may be needed in the
Tx slice. TxClk is used to drive the serializers and provide the output CLK+,CLK- to
Chiplet-B.

On the Rx side, the PHY must align the slicer clock to sample the data correctly.
This may be done with a DLL or adjustable delays or other methods.
The PHY shall include control logic to self-align the slicer clock for correct sampling of the data.
Alignment is started by signal AlignDll from the Rx Link Layer; 
the PHY provides a signal DllAligned to the Link Layer when it is complete.

All BoW interfaces shall be source synchronous within a slice. 
BoW Basic interfaces do not require per-wire alignment - the signals
within a slice are aligned sufficiently well by matching their paths.
BoW Fast interfaces may need per-wire delay adjustment or per-slicer clock adjustment.

Clock skew between the slices in each direction of a link depends on the implementation of the
TxClk distribution to all the Tx slices. 
That is, for the data flow from Chiplet A to Chiplet B, 
the TxClk distribution on Chiplet A sets the 
the clock skew of the Tx slices on Chiplet A and the clock skew of the Rx slices on Chiplet B,
and vice versa for flow from B to A. This skew must be no more than 3 ns.
There is no specification of the skew between TxClk on Chiplet A vs TxClk on Chiplet B.

~ Framed {color: blue}
Ed: 3 ns is sufficient to cover Tx clock distribution skew across a 30 mm chip edge.
Specifying a skew limit seems useful to clarify the requirements that will be imposed on 
the bonding FIFO in the Rx Link layer.
Do we want to weaken this to a Should?
~

On both the Tx and Rx sides, the Link layer must include a Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) to 
align the data between CoreClk and PhyClk. 
These CDCs must also be able to absorb the slice-to-slice clock skew and 
core clock distribution skew across the whole link.

If DCCs are included in the PHY and they need an alignment cycle, they shall include 
control logic to perform self-alignment on a signal AlignDcc from the Link layer to the PHY
and send a completion signal DccAligned back to the Link layer.

~ Framed {color: blue}
Ed: Need to use the same names for AlignDll, DllAligned, AlignDcc and DccAligned as in Logic Interface section.

~

V~hi~ of 0.75 V must be supported by all BoW implementations, but other values
may be supported.

t~eye~ must be evaluated for each of the bits in a slice
relative to the differential CLK+ - CLK- signal for that slice.
t~eye~ must be evaluated for CLK edges up to 3 UI earlier than the eye center.
This is because even though jitter on the data edges is correlated with the CLK jitter at
the Tx side, the slicer in the Rx side is likely to use a different CLK edge due to
delays in the Rx-side clock alignment circuit (usually a DLL).
The evaluation of jitter must include all possible jitter contributors, 
including reference clock, clock distribution networks, 
any DCC, PLL and DLL jitter, power-supply noise and switching noise.

The slice to slice clock skew t~skew~ across the width of a BoW link must be less than 3 ns.
This is dominated by the TxClk distribution network.

Since these signals do not leave the package, these values must be verified with simulation.

If the slice implementation allows programmatic control of the DLL alignment values, 
varying those values after locking the DLL may provide timing margin information.
If the slice implementation allows programmatic control of the receiver voltage 
thresholds, varying those values may provide vertical margin information.

# Electrical Specifications

## Voltages

To support a wide range of technologies BoW does not enforce a common 
VDD power rail voltage. In order to ensure that there is at least one common 
interoperable mode BoW implementations must support electrical specifications targeting 
rail to rail signaling based on a 0.75 V +/- 5% power supply (see electrical 
specifications). BoW interfaces can support higher or lower signaling 
voltages without limit but must support 0.75 V based signaling at 2 Gbps 
Double Data Rate (DDR) to ensure interoperability.
BoW does not enforce a common VDD power rail voltage. 

## ESD 
BOW I/O shall be designed to withstand 50 V CDM (Charged Device Model) and 
250 V HBM (Human Body Model).  This requirement is similar to other die-to-die 
interface standards.

## Termination and Return Loss

On laminate or similar packages, 
BoW Basic and BoW Fast transmitters shall be source-terminated to 50 +/-8 ohms.

BoW Basic receivers shall be unterminated.
BoW Fast receivers shall be terminated in 50 +/-8 ohms to V~swing~/2 +/- 5% where V~swing~
is the signal voltage swing without a receiver termination.

A BoW Basic transmitter (both data and clock) shall meet the return loss specified in
figure [#fig-s11] when outputting a logic 0, 1 or at the midscale voltage.
A BoW Fast transmitter and receiver shall meet the return loss specified in the same figure, 
when outputting a logic 0, 1 or at the midscale voltage.

## BoW Basic Channel Specifications

BoW Basic channel length on laminate 
is limited by the round trip reflection delay to 10 mm for 5 Gbps.

BoW Basic channels longer than 2 mm (e.g., on laminate) should meet these specs:

C~cross~ is the total capacitance of a wire to all its neighboring wires.
C~total~ is the total capacitance of a wire including to grounds.
Stripline (buried) wires with 25 um line, 40 um space and 33 um dielectric thickness have 
C~cross~/C~total~ of 28% and an impedance of 48 ohms.


Channels shorter than 2 mm (e.g., on interposer) will have different requirements, 
not yet specified.


~Framed {color: blue}
Interposers have only 4 layers, very thin dielectrics, 
cannot reach 50 ohm impedances without huge series R.  So they need to be designed differently.

Kens quick study found wire lengths from 570 to 1380 um 
(for 55 um bump pitch, 4-slice stack, 0.1 mm chip to chip spacing).
The best config looked like 3 um line and space, alternating signal and ground layers.
This gives a wire pitch of 1/9 the bump pitch, so we could even support 4 slices in just one
signal layer.
The line C for 1400 um is 0.76 pF, the R is 14 ohms, the RC is 11 ps, which is okay for 
8 Gb/s.
Source termination is probably not wanted in this case since there is so much Rline, 
the lines are short and
we cant build a reasonable controlled impedance line.

Is this enough data to spec a BoW Basic on interposer?  
Does anyone have more data?

# TX_AUX_DBI

Data Bus Inversion (DBI) is intended to mitigate simultaneous switching
 output (SSO) noise of a BoW PHY by limiting the number of BoW data bits
  that can switch between immediate data transfer cycles. 

DBI functionality is optional, but if implemented, DBI Mode shall 
be enabled by setting bit the AUX_DBI bit HI

With DBI on, DBI bits replace certain data bits on the data bus. 
The example below shows a 16 bit TX slice. RX wires have DBI at the same bit locations. 

## TX DBI with DBI Enabled 
Within a group of 16 data signals, the TX DBI logic calculates the DBI bit 
based on the number of data signals changing from their previous state on the BoW slice data bus. 
The DBI logic below uses “+” to indicate arithmetic addition, “^” to indicate 
exclusive OR, and “?” as a ternary IF. “Current” refers to the new data word 
being prepared for sending on TX. “Prev” refers to the data immediately preceding 
the current data, that is the data issued onto the AIB bus before the current data. 

DBIcurrent = ((data[15]current ^ data[15]prev) 
+ (data[14]current ^ data[14]prev) 
... 
+ (data[1]current ^ data[1]prev) 
+ (data[0]current ^ data[0]prev)) > 8 ? 1 : 0); 

Within a group of 16 data signals, if the DBI bit=1 then the
 TX DBI logic inverts the data signals. Each calculated DBI bit 
 replaces one data bit in TX as described previously. 

## RX DBI with DBI Enabled 
Within a group of 16 RX signals, the RX DBI logic extracts the DBI bit.
 If DBI = 1 then the RX DBI logic inverts the other RX bits. 

# Reset and Initialization

##Control Options


In a system with one or more BoW interfaces, each interface pair
 (defined as one Tx slice on a first chiplet and one Rx slice on a second chiplet)
 in the system shall achieve interface ready status in each of its component slices. 
 Once done, the interface shall signal readiness to the rest of the system. 
 If any BoW link or slice is down (either at the MAC or the PHY level), 
 it shall communicate this information to the appropriate interface partner as well as to the rest of the system.

Calibration and training will require the two endpoints of an interface to exchange status and control information.
 There is no dedicated sideband control interface defined. Instead, this exchange shall be facilitated 
 using an independent I2C (I3C) interface, assumed to exist outside of the BoW interface, on each chiplet.
  I2C(I3C) was chosen as the preferred interface for the following reasons:

* It is a two wire interface 
*	It is multi-point
* It supports multi-leader and multi-follower topology
*	The protocol for data reads and writes is standardized
*	It is widely used as a configuration/status monitoring interface 
*	It does not require additional control signals such as chip select (SPI, one per follower) or BSDL files (JTAG) to access register information

However, the system designer is free to choose any suitable method for their application.


An example BoW system configuration is shown in Figure 3. 
Any of the chiplets shown can act as an I2C (I3C) leader or follower. 
Alternatively, a central system controller (shown in dotted lines in the figure) 
shall behave as the leader and the BoW chiplets shall be followers.

To facilitate device identification and target communications at the proper device, 
link, and slice, each BoW Interface shall have a unique Device_ID, Link_ID, and Slice_ID. 
A BoW interface mapping table [connection topology] should also be     
provided by the system designer to facilitate proper assignment of link and 
slice states on each of the interface partners during initialization, calibration, or 
other sideband activity. The specifics of how this is topology information is propagated to 
each chiplet is left to the system designer.

##	Data-Transfer Ready
A data-transfer ready signal shall be made available for control by the MAC layer. 
The data-transfer ready signal may be de-asserted due to application-driven changes, including but not limited to:

* An intentional change in clock frequency
* Receipt of bad data

De-asserting the data-transfer ready signal may also be necessary due to conditions within the BoW interface, which may include but are not limited to:

* Completion of configuration during power-up
* Initiation of reset by the link partner
* Loss of DLL lock

Internal BoW conditions indicating the need for de-assertion of the data-transfer ready signal 
shall be sent to the MAC so that the MAC can de-assert the data-transfer ready signal.
Once data-transfer ready has been re-asserted after having been de-asserted, the 
BoW Adapter shall be re-calibrated (Section 11). The reverse is not true: 
calibration may be initiated without de-asserting data-transfer ready first.

##Standby Mode

A signal shall be placed into standby mode by one of the following means:

* Driving the signal LO
* Putting the signal into tristate and enabling the weak pull-down. During initialization, 
data outputs shall be placed into standby mode.

##	Data-Transfer Ready Signals

Each slice shall have a tx_mac_rdy signal that is controlled by the Transmit MAC. 
When the tx_mac_rdy signal is asserted HI by the MAC, it shall indicate that the 
transmit slice is ready for calibration and data transfer. De-assertion of 
tx_mac_rdy shall affect only its own slice; other slices may continue transmitting data.

    The tx_mac_rdy signal shall be forwarded to the link partner, and appropriate status 
    and control register shall be updated, in order to inform the Receive MAC 
    that the Transmit MAC is or is not ready for calibration.

##	The Effects of De-asserting Data-Transfer Ready

While the tx_mac_rdy signal is de-asserted:

~framed {color:Blue}
[Note: because this is not a hardwired signal, there
 is a latency in response depending on the polling frequency of the I2C sideband interface. 
 Need to investigate whether there is a mechanism where each chiplet can become a 
 Leader dynamically and broadcast changes in status to its link partner]
~

* Data transmission shall halt
* Data outputs shall be placed into standby mode (Section 9.3)
* The clock output tx_fwd_clk shall go into standby mode.
* The reset signal tx_mac_rdy shall be sent to the interface partner in order to communicate that data transmission has halted and to allow for the interface partner to be reset.

The contents of any retiming registers in the data path shall be undefined following 
de- assertion of data-transfer ready.
De-assertion of the data-transfer ready signal shall not affect the
 free-running clock signals or the -control signals.
 
##	Initialization

Initialization will consist of three steps in sequence:

* Power-on reset synchronization
* Configuration
* Calibration 


~ Figure { #fig-bow_init; caption: "BoW Initialization " }
![bow_init]
~
[bow_init]: images/bow_init.png { width:auto; max-width:90% }

If there are multiple BoW interfaces on a single chiplet, 
they shall all come out of configuration at the same time, 
but they may complete adapter reset and calibration at different times depending on implementation.

## Power-on Reset Synchronization
Power-on reset, being the first step in initialization, shall not require 
any features enabled by configuration, since configuration will not occur until after power-on reset.

##	Power-on Reset Signals
One signal (register bit) shall participate in power-on reset: power_on_reset.

##	Power-on Reset Sequence
During power-on reset, all input and output signals shall be placed 
into standby mode (Section 9.3). The power-on reset sequence shall proceed as follows:

1.	If no paired device_ID signal is detected by the Receive, then the Receive may act both to ensure that it and its chiplet are in a safe state and to alert the MAC.
2.	If no paired device_ID signal is detected by the Transmit, then the Transmit may act both to ensure that it and its chiplet are in a safe state and to alert the MAC
3.	Each chiplet shall implement its own power-on reset routine. At the beginning of the routine, Receive interfaces shall assert their power_on_reset signals HI.
4.	When a chiplet completes its power-on reset sequence:
  a.	Transmit interfaces shall begin the configuration stage.
  b.	Receive interfaces shall de-assert their power_on_reset signals LO and begin the configuration stage.

##	Unused Interfaces
In order to ensure correct operation for chiplets with unused Transmit interfaces, the
power_on_reset  register bits for those unused interfaces shall be set HI.
In order to ensure correct operation for chiplets with unused Receive interfaces, the
Device_ID register bits for those unused interfaces shall be set  to 0x0000.

##	Test Provision

~framed {color:Green}
In order to test the power-on reset sequence at the wafer level, 
two signals shall be provided for use by automated test equipment to 
override the power_on_reset and device_detect signals when there 
is no Transmit/Receive pair available. por_ovrd overrides the power_on_reset signal, 
and device_detect_ovrd overrides the device_detect signal.
~

#Configuration

Configuration may include:

* Host chiplet configuration (in the case of an FPGA or similar chiplet)
* BoW interface configuration
* BoW redundancy activation

The tx_mac_rdy signal shall be de-asserted LO during configuration and shall be asserted HI when configuration completes and the chiplet is ready for calibration and data transfer. The clock input from the MAC shall be stable prior to assertion of tx_mac_rdy.

##	Output State During Configuration

All outputs, including data outputs, shall be in standby mode (Section 9.3) during configuration. 

##	Chiplet Configuration

Configuration of any non-BoW aspects of the chiplet is outside the scope of this specification.

##	BoW Interface Configuration

All intended BoW features shall be configured at power-up.

## JTAG Configuration

The chiplet data sheet should document the configuration requirements that allow for successfully implementation of JTAG EXTEST and INTEST operations.

Control Shift Register Readiness

The control shift register shall be operational once configuration is complete.

##	Configuration Completion Signals

~framed {color:Green}
[Instead of conf_done, can we use this mechanism as a global interrupt to allow the side-band to 
respond with more immediacy or retain its conf_done status prior to calibration. 
Post link initialization, reuse it as a global interrupt signal. I think this can be 
done cleanly based on the status of a number of other signals participating in the initialization process]
~
Each chiplet shall have a conf_done signal. conf_done shall be an open-drain output. 
It shall be asserted LO when configuring, and it shall be released when configuration of 
all interfaces on the chiplet is complete, the analog circuits are stable, and the free-running 
clock is stable. conf_done shall indicate only that BoW configuration is complete. 
No other configuration completion (MAC, FPGA, etc.) shall be included in the generation of
the conf_done signal.

All conf_done signals from all chiplets of a module should be connected in a wired-AND 
configuration to generate a module-level CONF_DONE signal that shall be HI
 when all chiplets on the module have completed BoW configuration. The pull-up resistor 
 used to implement the wired-AND function may reside on the module containing the chiplets 
 with BoW interfaces, or it may reside off the module. The CONF_DONE signal should be 
 provided as an output of the module regardless of the resistor placement.

![bow_config_complete]
~
[bow_config_complete]: images/bow_config_done.png { width:auto; max-width:70% }

Data outputs shall remain in standby mode (Section 9.3) until CONF_DONE is asserted,
including in the case where CONF_DONE is pulled low some time after being asserted high.

The resistance and VDD values should comply with

+--------------------+-------+
| Parameter          | Value |
+--------------------+-------+
| Pull-up resistance | 1kOhm |
+--------------------+-------+
| Pull-up Vdd        | 0.9V  |
+--------------------+-------+
~

#	Calibration 

The calibration sequence shall proceed as follows:

* Adapter reset
* Data path calibration

A BoW interface shall have an tx_adapter_rstn signal that is asserted by the MAC. 
It shall be forwarded to the link partner of the interface through the register interface.


When either the Transmit (tx_adapter_rstn) or Receive (rx_adapter_rstn) adapter 
reset signal is asserted LO, the adapter shall reset the calibration state machines. 
If adapter reset follows de-assertion of data- transfer ready, tx(rx)_mac_rdy 
must be asserted HI before tx(rx)_adapter_rstn is asserted HI.

##	Data-Path Calibration

Data-path calibration shall be implemented via state machines on the Transmit
 and Receive sides of the interface that intercommunicate via the  control signals.


~ Figure { #fig-data_path_calibration; caption: "Data-Path Calibration Architecture" }
![data_path_calibration]
~
[data_path_calibration]: images/data_path_calibration.png { width:auto; max-width:90% }

Following the de-assertion of the adapter-reset signal(s), a calibration request
 shall be made by asserting a calibration request signal. Either the transmit or receive slice
 can initiate data path calibration.

Datapath calibration shall comply with Figure [#fig-data_path_state_machine]. The numbers in black indicate the sequence of steps

## Adapter Reset

Data-path calibration shall be initiated when the MAC layer asserts the 
tx_adapter_rstn signal LO. If the data-transfer ready signal was de-asserted prior 
to the start of calibration, then the tx_mac_rdy signal must be asserted HI prior 
to asserting the adapter-reset signals HI
The MAC must de-assert the adapter-reset signal prior to requesting calibration start.

## Calibration Request

Calibration can be requested by either the Transmit or the Receive slice 
using the tx_dcc_dll_lock_req signal or the rx_dcc_dll_lock_req signal, respectively.

~ TableFigure {#tab-calib_init; caption: "Calibration Initiation Signals"; width:100%; }

+-----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| Calibration Initiator | Dataflow direction  | Initiation signal   |
+-----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|                       |                     |                     |
| Transmit              | Transmit to Receive | tx_dcc_dll_lock_req |
+-----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|                       |                     |                     |
| Receive               | Receive to Transmit | rx_dcc_dll_lock_req |
+-----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
~


Calibration for a dataflow direction shall commence when either Transmit 
and Receive side has asserted its calibration request signal for 
that dataflow direction. Calibration request signals shall remain asserted 
until a new calibration is requested.

## DCC Calibration

Upon receipt of an xx_dcc_dll_lock_req signal, the DCC shall be calibrated. 
The means of calibration is not specified and is left to the designer. 
If the optional DCC is not present, then the state machine in Section 11.1
 shall remain the same, with the DCC calibration state serving only to provide a 
 signal indicating DCC calibration completion.

## DLL Calibration
Following DCC calibration, the receiving DLL shall be calibrated. 
The means of calibrating the DLL is not specified and is left to the designer.
If the optional DLL is not present, then the state machine in Section 11.1
 shall remain the same, with the DLL lock state serving only to provide a signal indicating DLL lock completion.

## Calibration Completion

Calibration completion shall be indicated by the following signals.
 Full completion shall be indicated when all four signals are asserted HI. 
 All four signals, once asserted, shall remain asserted until a new calibration sequence is requested.

##	BoW Link Ready

When both tx_transfer_en and rx_transfer_en are true, then the link shall be ready to transmit data.

#Testability

## Test Pattern
Suggested test patterns are:

* PRBS-9 Pattern, defined  by polynomial of X^9^+ X^5^ +1

* PRBS-31 Pattern, defined by polynomial of X^31^ + X^28^ +1

Furthermore, to cover the DC wandering and single  bit response, the following suggested pattern should be added to the beginning of the preferred 
PRBS pattern.

['0'] X 10 + '1' + ['0'] X 10 + ['1'] X 10 + '0' + ['1'] X 10 + ['0'] X 10

## Loopback Test

A BoW interface will be used for loopback testing in two use cases: 
at wafer-sort time for chiplet test for full-system bring-up, and debug validation. 
  
  
  Wafer sort tests are currently only practical for the BoW interface with regular bump pitches (~130um), where ATE (automatic testing equipment) probe boards with matching pin pitches are available. Microbump probes will require additional effort.

Unidirectional links will need open-loop testing. 
In Tx-Open-Loop testing, shown in Figure [#fig_test_tx], Chiplet-A transmits a known test pattern (PRBS9 or PRBS31) to a golden reference receiver through the ATE load board. 
The received pattern is verified in the ATE load board.

Rx-Open-Loop testing, shown in Figure [#fig_test_rx], is used for a link where the DUT is only a receiver. 
A golden reference Tx transmits a known pattern (PRBS9 or PRBS31) through the channel to the chiplet. The received pattern will be analyzed for quality and functional tests.

In bidirectional links, loopback tests can be implemented in two modes:

 * short loopback mode: Data is looped back within the chip (shown in Figure [#fig_test_sl]). 
 The short loopback can be triggered by the ATE. 
 * long loopback mode , 
 the PRBS pattern is generated by chiplet-A, sent over the replica channel on the ATE load board which loops it back 
 (shown in Figure [#fig_test_ll]). 
 The received pattern will be passed to a bit error rate tester (BERT) to analyze the performance of the link with off-chip data and clock wires.

Both loopback modes can potentially be used for in-field validation bring-up and test. 
Cooperation across chiplets will be required to execute these tests in the field. 
Open-loop testing requires the use of a fixed test pattern recognized by both ends and is the only option for unidirectional links. 
Long loopback mode can be implemented on interposer or organic laminate for validation/verification purposes. 

Figure [#fig_test_cll] shows how a long loopback mode is executed across two chiplets for in-field validation and test 
where Tx and Rx are in different chiplets. Furthermore, this configuration can be expanded to loop back the data from the transmitter of chiplet-A to the receiver of chiplet-A.
